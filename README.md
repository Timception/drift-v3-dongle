## ðŸ”„ Reflashing Instructions

If your keyboard already has firmware installed, you usually donâ€™t need to reflash.  
But if you want to update to the latest build, hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Download the latest firmware**  
   - Go to the **[Actions tab](https://github.com/Timception/drift-v3-dongle/actions)** in this repo.  
   - Open the latest successful build and download the **firmware .zip file**.

2. **Unzip the file**  
   - Inside youâ€™ll find multiple `.uf2` files:       
     - `drift_central_dongle.uf2` â†’ Dongle firmware  
     - `drift_left.uf2` â†’ Left half firmware  
	 - `drift_left_central.uf2` â†’ No Dongle (Left half acts as central - standard bluetooth)  
     - `drift_right.uf2` â†’ Right half firmware  
	 - `settings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` â†’ Settings Reset firmware (needed to clean devices before new firmware)  

3. **Reset the dongle**  
   - Plug in your dongle.  
   - Double-click the **reset button** on the dongle.  
   - A new drive should appear on your computer.

4. **Flash the reset firmware**  
   - Drag `settings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` into the new bootloader drive.  
   - Wait until the dongle reboots.  

5. **Repeat reset step for each keyboard half**  
   - Double-click the reset button on the **left half** â†’ drag `settings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` into the bootloader drive.  
   - Do the same for the **right half**.  

6. **Flash the NEW dongle firmware**  
   - Plug in the dongle again.  
   - Double-click reset â†’ drag `drift_central_dongle.uf2` into the drive.  
   - Wait for it to finish.  

7. **Flash the left half with new firmware**  
   - Plug in the **left half**.  
   - Double-click reset near the power switch.  
   - Drag `drift_left.uf2` into the bootloader drive.  

8. **Flash the right half with new firmware**  
   - Repeat the same process with the **right half**, using `drift_right.uf2`.  

9. **Reconnect everything**  
   - Unplug the halves.  
   - Plug the dongle back in.  
   - Press the reset button once on each half so they reconnect to the dongle.  

10. âœ… Youâ€™re done!  
	- Download [ZMK Studio](https://zmk.studio/download), or
    - Open the [ZMK Studio](https://studio.zmk.dev) app online to see your Drift keyboard.  
    - Now you can view and customize your keys to your hearts content.
